My sandbox for creating test apps using Jasonette (created by [Ethan](https://github.com/gliechtenstein), see [this post on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-build-cross-platform-mobile-apps-using-nothing-more-than-a-json-markup-f493abec1873#.xtlej7dsu)).

Basically it's an easy way to build apps from pure JSON.

My first Jasonette app made from pure JSON:  It worked!  Proof:
